### **SSC-SB: Semantic Similarity Contrast-based Street Block Monitoring**  

This repository contains the implementation of **SSC-SB (Semantic Similarity Contrast-based Street Block Monitoring)**, a contrastive learning-based approach for monitoring street block development and renewal using **Sentinel-2 time series imagery**.

## **Pipeline**  

### **1. Train the Model**  
To train the model from scratch, run the following command:  
```bash
python modelTrain.py
```  

### **2. Run SSC-SB for Street Block Monitoring**  
Once the model is trained or pre-trained weights are downloaded, run:  
```bash
python blockMonitoring.py
```  
This will generate the SSC-SB monitoring results.
